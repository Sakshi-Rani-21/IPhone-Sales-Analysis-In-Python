# iPhone Sales Analysis using Python  
This project analyzes iPhone sales data to uncover trends and insights using Python.

## Project Overview
In Data Analysis, the analyst must ensure that the data is 'clean' before doing any analysis. 'Dirty' data can lead to unreliable, inaccurate and/or misleading result

The project involves the following steps:
1. **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and removing duplicate records from the dataset.
2. **Standardizing Data**: Cleaning and standardizing data entries.
3. **Handling Null or Blank Values**: Addressing missing or blank values.
4. **Visualising Data**: Data vizualisation using bar graphs and scatter plots.


## Analysis
The analysis includes:

- Overall Sales by Year: A line plot showing annual iPhone sales.
- Sales by Model: A bar plot showing total sales by iPhone model.
- Highest Rated Models: A bar plot showing the number of ratings for the highest-rated iPhone models.
