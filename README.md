# iPhone Sales Analysis using Python  
This project analyzes iPhone sales data to uncover trends and insights using Python.

## Project Overview
In Data Analysis, the analyst must ensure that the data is 'clean' before doing any analysis. 'Dirty' data can lead to unreliable, inaccurate and/or misleading result

The project involves the following steps:
1.**Importing data**:Importing csv data using pthon library pandas.
2. **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and removing duplicate records from the dataset.
3. **Standardizing Data**: Cleaning and standardizing data entries.
4. **Handling Null or Blank Values**: Addressing missing or blank values.
5. **Visualising Data**: Data vizualisation using bar graphs and scatter plots.


## Analysis
The analysis includes:

- Top 10 iPhones by their ratings: A [bar plot](https://github.com/Sakshi-Rani-21/IPhone-Sales-Analysis-In-Python/blob/main/Number%20of%20ratings%20of%20highest%20ranked%20iPhones.png) showing number of ratings of top 10 iphones.
- Top 10 iPhones by their reviews: A [bar plot](https://github.com/Sakshi-Rani-21/IPhone-Sales-Analysis-In-Python/blob/main/Number%20of%20ratings%20of%20highest%20ranked%20iPhones.png) showing number of ratings of top 10 iphones.
- Sales by Model: A bar plot showing total sales by iPhone model.
- Highest Rated Models: A bar plot showing the number of ratings for the highest-rated iPhone models.
